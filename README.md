# Power-Regulation-of-a-PMSG-Based-Wind-Energy-Conversion-System-Using-Pitch-Angle-Control
Modeling and simulation of a PMSG-based wind energy conversion system with pitch angle control for power regulation. The project focuses on turbine operation in high wind speed (above-rated) conditions, where aerodynamic power must be limited to ensure stable and safe system operation.

# Objectives

Develop a simulation model of a variable-speed PMSG wind energy system.

Implement pitch angle control for regulating turbine power output.

Study the role of pitch control in maintaining stable operation under changing wind speeds.
